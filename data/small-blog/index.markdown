# About

This is a small blog generated by the Hakyll static site generator. We use the
`small-blog` premade configuration, which means we can set up our blog very
quickly, without the need to write much code.

This site should serve as a good starting point for your own blog. If you want
to create a larger or more feature-rich site, you should consider learning
[Hakyll].
